99 Slices (Bottles) of Beer
=============================

My take, in Python (2.7.5) on the classic '99 Bottles of Beer' program, that prints the lyrics to '99 Bottles of Beer' out in the console/command prompt. I have chosen to use string slicing and formatting to achieve this in Python. Kind of a weird way to do it, I know, but that was the idea.

**[See a demo.](http://repl.it/MTx)**

**Features:**

- Prints out the lyrics to '99 Bottles of Beer' to the python console, or command prompt! AMAZING, I know!
